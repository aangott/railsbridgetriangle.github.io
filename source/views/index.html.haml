      %h3 We're Here to Help
      %p
        We welcome you to the Triangle Ruby community. Whatever your goal is in
        learning to program, we will connect you with the tools to take the next step.
      %p
        Led by an all-volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic Ruby and Rails
        developers, the workshop will introduce attendees who have little or no programming
        experience to the concepts, tools, and techniques of Ruby and Rails development.

    %h3 A Diversity of Perspectives == Better Code
    %p
      When we embrace differences, we enrich the quality of all our work, our
      discussions, and our products. Technology made by a more diverse industry
      serves a more diverse world.
    %p
      RailsBridge is working to make tech more diverse and welcoming. We organize
      and teach free programming workshops, targeted at groups of people that are
      underrepresented in tech (women, minorities, LGBTQ, etc).
    %p
      We support mothers who want to code. We will provide professional childcare
      — at your home — to those who need it. Please let us know if you want to use
      these services on the application form.
