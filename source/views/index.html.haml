      %h3 We're Here to Help
      %p
        We welcome you to the Triangle Ruby community. Whatever your goal is in
        learning to program, we will connect you with the tools to take the next
        step.
      %p
        Led by an all-volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic Ruby and
        Rails developers, the workshop will introduce attendees who have little
        or no programming experience to the concepts, tools, and techniques of
        Ruby and Rails development.

    %h3 A Diversity of
    %h3 Perspectives == Better Code
    %p
      When we embrace differences, we enrich the quality of all our work, our
      discussions, and our products. Technology made by a more diverse industry
      serves a more diverse world.
    %p
      RailsBridge Triangle organizes and teaches free programming workshops,
      targeted at groups of people that are underrepresented in tech (women,
      minorities, LGBTQ, etc).  We are working to make tech more diverse and
      welcoming -- starting with Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.
    %p
      You may register as a student if you identify as a member of one of these
      groups. If you don't, we encourage you to share RailsBridge with your
      friends who do! Registered students may bring with them any one guest of
      their choice.
    %p
      We support mothers who want to code. We will provide professional
      childcare — at your home — to those who need it. Please let us know if you
      want to use these services on the application form.
